# Trending Cryptocurrencies

This is an educational project for me to learn and apply ideas involving http and API requests, and building command line tools. 

## Project Description

This project will involve building a command line interface (CLI) tool that interacts with the API of [Coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/)
  * Full documentation of Coingecko's API can be found at https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation

The goal of this CLI tool is to display basic information regarding the current "trending cryptocurrencies"
  * Coingecko API defines the current trending cryptocurrencies as the 7 most searched cryptocurrencies on the site within the last 24 hours (ordered by most popular first).
  
**This README will update as the project progresses** 

## Features
- [ ] List the top 7 trending cryptocurrencies (by ID)
- [ ] Price of each cryptocurrency in BTC
- [ ] Price of each token in USD (not directly accessible through API endpoints)



## TODO
- Implement CLI tool
