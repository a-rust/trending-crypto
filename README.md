# Trending Cryptocurrencies

This is an educational project for me to learn and apply ideas involving http and API requests, and building command line tools.

## Project Description

* This project will involve building a command line tool that interacts with the API of [Coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/)  

* Full documentation of Coingecko's API can be found at https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation

* The 'search/trending' endpoint of the API gives the top 7 most searched cryptocurrencies within the last 24 hours

* **This README will update as the project progresses** 

## Steps taken (note to self; will remove later)

API:
- [x] Find API baseurl and endpoint for trending cryptocurrencies
- [x] Define a function that will return the json format of the data
- [x] Define an empty list, and a function that will store the id (name) of each trending cryptocurrency in that list


Command Line Tool:
