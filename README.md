# Trending Cryptocurrencies
This was an educational project for me to learn and apply ideas involving http and API requests using the requests package, and building command line tools using the argparse package. 

## Project Description
This project will involve building a command line interface (CLI) tool that interacts with the API of [Coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/)
  * Full documentation of Coingecko's API can be found at https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation

The goal of this CLI tool is to display basic information regarding the current "trending cryptocurrencies"
  * Coingecko API defines the current trending cryptocurrencies as the 7 most searched cryptocurrencies on the site within the last 24 hours (ordered by most popular first).

## Features
- [x] List the top 7 trending cryptocurrencies (ID, price in BTC, and price in USD)
- [x] Optional argument to query the $n$th top trending cryptocurrency (returns ID, price in BTC, and price in USD)
